#Feature Freeze
Version 3 of our date picker is currently in a feature freeze. Version 4 is comming very soon. We are working on updating the docs and getting existing bugs and features rolled up into v4. We will continue to fix minor bugs in v3 in the meantime, but all new features should go into v4.
