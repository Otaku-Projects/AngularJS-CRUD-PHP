#AngularJS-CRUD-PHP

A simple idea for Rapid application development

#Log

Large improvement as at 27 Sep 2016, but some reason I cannot upload here now.
See you all later.

##Demo

Sorry, my site was expired. Show to you at someday on somewhere.

##Motivation

There were too many angularJS CRUD open source project in the real, angularJS has received significant recognition since recent years but we are still uncertainty what angularJS can and how much it can. Over the years, the numerous CRUD sample has been made, focus on routeProvider, angularJS <--> Java, angularJS <--> PHP. A vast amount of related work have been created by thousands of people from all over the world.

It is very limiting of my needs(maybe also yours). One day when a project need to provide CRUD on more than one table on one single page. But implement of such sample was copy and edit many lines of HTML. It was so tired and easy to make mistakes. I just want a simple and a lite angularJS controller to help us to develop on the small project.

<!--
##Features

- easy to provide Create, Read, Update Delete functions with a signal <crud> tag
- 
-->

##Requirement

- PHP 5.4 or above
- angularJS 1.5.0 or above
- jQuery 2.2.1 or above
- bootstrap 3.3.0 or above (optional)
- font awesome 4.5.0 or above (optional)

##Dependency

- angularJS 1.5.0 or above
- jQuery 2.2.1 or above
- jquery.cookie 1.4.1
- Blob.js
- FileSaver.js 1.3.2

##Architecture

This project is divided into three parts, PHP core, angularJS and HTML template. PHP core handle the mysql query execution and return a json response, the core is develop under MVC model, view is jQuery+HTML+angularJS.

##Ideally Design
AngulasJS provides the \<entry\> \<pageview\> \<screen\> \<editbox\> \<import-export\> directive, entry directive handle the action of [Create | View | Update | Delete] of any entries.

This project design for the function base, a page can be a function, a directive can be a function, a page allowed to provide multi directive. \<screen\> directive is a template directive for reuseable \<pageview\>, \<screen\> also work for \<entry\>. \<editbox\> is control set to handle foreign key, to popup a \<pageview\> to find the tuple from the foreign table. select a tuple to assign the FK to the field of the entry, the FK record details may display in the \<editbox\>.

In the future, \<pageview\> can be a selection range for the search criteria selection. Better handling for one to many relationship between the parent and the child table.

 Root
 ├---js
 |    ├--- config.js ( config of app.js )
 |    ├--- app.js ( angularJS core)
 |    └--- directive.js ( angularJS directive )
 ├---controller
 |    └--- EntryAControllerA.php ( handle business rule of entry )
 ├---model (role for communicate to MySQL server)
 |    ├--- ConnectionManager.php (centralize the HTTP request and HTTP response)
 |    ├--- DatabaseManager.php (provide insert(), select(), update(), delete() to access MySQL)
 |    ├--- TableAManager.php (inheritance to DatabaseManager.php, allow to overwrite the insert(), select(), update(), delete())
 ├---Templates
 |    ├--- entry.html ( entry directive optional template)
 |    └--- pageview.html ( pageview directive optional template)
 ├---third-party
      ├---bootstrap-3.3.0
      └---angular.min.js

Please do not hesitate to perform your professional on PULL requests when you found out some current insufficient. I am  apologise in advance for my working places not convenient to use GitHub frequently, my work may sticking around a month or waiting a great enhancement and then will batch update at here. For any good ideas who would nice reduce the user configuration, reduce the implementation coding, minimize the back end coding with a better algorithm, improve this little project are much welcome. I will follow the action on pull requests and issues at once.
